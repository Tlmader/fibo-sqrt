# fibo-sqrt
MIPS assembler instructions for calculating index of fibonacci sequence and square root.

Sqrt.s computes the square root of a given number. The program accepts a number x in the .data section,
which can be a negative or positive number as well as it can be an integer or a real number.

Fibo.s recursively computes and returns the Fibonacci number corresponding to a given index in the .data section.
